# PLA Forge v0.2

## Build Plate Planner
- Colour-first planning
- Mix different Pals using the same filament
- Remaining-to-print = demand - printed stock - active plate allocation
- Add grouped production STLs
- Add individual recovery/spare STLs manually
- Draft / Printing / Complete / Cancelled plate states
- Plate IDs: PLATE-0001, PLATE-0002...
- Optional printer and plate note
- Estimated filament grams
- Passed/failed confirmation on completion
- Successful output moves to Printed Parts Inventory
- Failed quantities recorded
- Printed Parts page with grouped sets and recovery spares

## Updating GitHub Pages
You only need to replace/upload these changed files for v0.2:
- assets/forge.js
- assets/forge.css
- plates.html
- parts.html
- index.html
- README.md

Your existing data folder can stay as it is.

## Storage
v0.2 still uses browser localStorage for operational state until the shared backend is built.


## v0.2.1 Settings upgrade

- New site-wide `Settings` page
- Add / disable / delete printers
- Store printer name, model, nozzle and build volume
- Choose a default printer
- Build Plate Planner now pulls its printer dropdown from Settings
- No more free-text printer names on plates


## v0.2.2 hotfix
- Fixed Add Printer handling on Settings
- Added visible success/error feedback
- Build Plate Planner printer control is now a true Settings-backed dropdown
- Added cache-busted CSS/JS references so GitHub Pages does not serve the old interface
- Restyled all text boxes, number fields and dropdowns to the dark PLA Forge theme

## v0.2.3 Build Plate UX
- Removed the separate Extra / Recovery Part panel
- Added an `Extra` column directly to every colour-group row
- `+ Extra` adds one additional grouped print set even when Remaining is zero
- Extra successful prints are stored in the same Printed Parts inventory and reduce future print demand

## v0.2.4 Exact Part Printing
- Keeps inline Add and + Extra controls
- Adds Exact Part on any row with separate recovery STL files
- Exact Part expands directly below the same Pal/colour group
- Select one specific STL and quantity
- Exact recovery parts are stored separately in Printed Parts Inventory

## v0.2.7 Kitsu Print Queue
- New `Colours You Need to Print` section above the existing Build Plate Planner
- Only colours with outstanding production demand are shown
- Each colour shows outstanding grouped sets, estimated filament grams, number of Pals, and number of recipe groups
- Colours are prioritised by outstanding quantity
- Clicking a colour selects it in the existing detailed checklist below
- Existing Add / + Extra / Exact Part workflow remains unchanged
